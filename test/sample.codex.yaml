      Aria was born in the small village of Moonhaven, nestled at the

    name: "Chapter 1: The Awakening"
    summary: |
      Aria discovers her true power during the Festival of Lights.
    body: |
      The Festival of Lights came once a year to Moonhaven, when
      the three moons aligned in the sky and the village was bathed
      in silver radiance. It was during this festival, in her
      seventeenth year, that Aria's life changed forever.
      
      She stood at the edge of the village square, watching the
      other children release their carefully crafted paper lanterns
      into the night sky. Each lantern carried a wish, a hope,
      a dream for the coming year.

        body: |
          Torchlight flickered across the cobblestones as villagers
          gathered in the square. The smell of honey cakes and
          spiced cider filled the air.

        body: |
          As Aria reached for her lantern, something strange happened.
          Light began to pour from her fingertips, not the soft glow
          of a candle, but brilliant beams of pure radiance.

      Aria leaves Moonhaven to begin her training at the Academy.
    body: |
      Three days after the Festival, Elder Moonshadow called Aria
      to her cottage at the edge of the village. The old mage's
      eyes held both pride and sorrow as she handed the young woman
      a sealed letter.
      
      "The Academy has accepted you," she said. "You must go."
