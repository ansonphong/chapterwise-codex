# Scrivener Project File Format – Comprehensive Technical Overview

## Overview of Scrivener’s Project Structure (Mac & Windows)

Scrivener stores a writing project as a **project folder** with a “.scriv” extension. On macOS, this appears as a single file (a **package** that Finder treats like a file), but it’s actually a regular folder containing many components[\[1\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=Since%20the%20developers%20of%20Scrivener,called%20a%20Document%20Package%20format)[\[2\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=Scrivener%20projects%20are%20stored%20in,it%3B%20it%E2%80%99s%20merely%20a%20folder). On Windows, the “.scriv” is just a normal folder. In both cases, *the entire folder* constitutes the project – not just a single file[\[3\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=A%20complete%20Scrivener%20project%20is,scriv%20extension)[\[2\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=Scrivener%20projects%20are%20stored%20in,it%3B%20it%E2%80%99s%20merely%20a%20folder). Inside the .scriv folder, several key items define the project:

* **Project Main File (.scrivx or .scrivproj)** – an XML file that serves as the “binder index,” listing all documents and metadata[\[4\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=Within%20the%20,file%20and%20extension%2C%20keyword%20info)[\[5\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=4,filled%20glory). (Older Mac versions used a binary binder.scrivproj file instead of XML[\[6\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=The%20XML%20has%20enough%20to,3%20uses%20project%20version%202).)

* **Files Folder** – contains the actual content files (manuscript text, research files) and ancillary data like indexes and backups[\[7\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=tree%20Scrivener3,indexes)[\[8\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=1,text%20written%20by%20the%20user).

* **Settings Folder** – stores UI state and project-specific settings (e.g. interface layout, recent files)[\[9\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20writing.history%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Scrivener3,common.xml%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20ui.ini)[\[10\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=preview,with%20or%20otherwise%20include).

* **Snapshots Folder** – stores snapshot copies (historical versions) of documents (created when you take “snapshots” in Scrivener)[\[11\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-to-see-overall-size-of-snapshots-and-delete-old-ones/132297#:~:text=Navigate%20into%20your%20,seconds%20for%20that%20to%20happen).

* **QuickLook Folder** (macOS projects) – contains data for macOS Finder’s Quick Look preview (e.g. a preview image or HTML of the binder)[\[12\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=2,fiddle%20with%20or%20otherwise%20include). *(This is not essential to the project’s content and may be absent on Windows.)*

* **Optional Mobile Folder** – appears if the project was synced with iOS Scrivener. iOS changes are temporarily stored here and merged into the main project when opened on desktop[\[13\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/mobile-folder-in-project-folder/121177#:~:text=,and%20the%20Mobile%20folder%20disappears). After merging (rebuilding indices), the Mobile folder is removed by Scrivener[\[14\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/mobile-folder-in-project-folder/121177#:~:text=,and%20the%20Mobile%20folder%20disappears)[\[15\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/mobile-folder-in-project-folder/121177#:~:text=Correct,main%20body%20of%20the%20project).

**Important:** To back up or transfer a project, one must copy the entire .scriv folder (including all subfolders/files), not just the .scrivx file[\[3\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=A%20complete%20Scrivener%20project%20is,scriv%20extension)[\[16\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=So%2C%20if%20you%20want%20to,%E2%80%98Backup%20As%20Zip%20File%E2%80%99%20option). The .scrivx is crucial but it **is not the whole project** – it’s essentially an index into the folder’s contents.

## The Project XML File (.scrivx / Binder File)

At the heart of every Scrivener project is the **project XML file**, usually named after the project with a “.scrivx” extension (e.g. MyNovel.scrivx). This file contains the entire **binder structure and metadata** for the project[\[4\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=Within%20the%20,file%20and%20extension%2C%20keyword%20info)[\[5\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=4,filled%20glory). (In older Mac versions, this was binder.scrivproj – a binary plist file[\[6\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=The%20XML%20has%20enough%20to,3%20uses%20project%20version%202) – but modern versions use .scrivx XML on both platforms for compatibility.) Key characteristics of the .scrivx binder file include:

* **XML Root and Project Info:** The root element \<ScrivenerProject\> holds project-level attributes. For example, a Scrivener 3 project might start like:

* \<ScrivenerProject Template="No" Version="2.0"  
      Identifier="DF5DA7F0-27DB-4815-A050-B4D6F23CABA7"  
      Creator="SCRWIN-3.1.5.1" Device="DESKTOP-JMM4K7M"  
      Modified="2025-03-14 22:15:28 \-0600" ModID="B4A944C3-FF79-49F6-A737-158BEB4E58BB"\>

* Here **Version** indicates the internal format version (e.g. 1.0 for older projects, 2.0 for Scrivener 3\)[\[17\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=cat%20Scrivener3,14). The Identifier is a unique project GUID, and Creator/Device note which Scrivener version and machine last saved it[\[17\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=cat%20Scrivener3,14). The XML header also notes if the project was created from a template, and timestamps of last modification.

* **Binder Hierarchy (\<Binder\> Section):** Inside the root, the \<Binder\> element contains a nested tree of \<BinderItem\> elements representing each folder or document in the binder (Draft, Research, Trash, and all subdocuments)[\[18\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%3CBinder%3E%20%3CBinderItem%20UUID%3D%2217807D28,Children)[\[19\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%3CChildren%3E%20%3CBinderItem%20UUID%3D%22921B4A08,0600). Each BinderItem has attributes and child elements capturing its properties:

* **Unique ID:** In older projects, a numeric ID attribute was used (e.g. ID="8")[\[20\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,%3CTextSettings). In Scrivener 3, a UUID attribute (32-character hex GUID) uniquely identifies the item[\[19\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%3CChildren%3E%20%3CBinderItem%20UUID%3D%22921B4A08,0600). This ID/UUID links the binder entry to its content file on disk (see “Files Folder” below).

* **Type:** A type designator for the item’s role. Common types include "Text" (a text document), "Folder" (an ordinary folder), and special types like "DraftFolder", "ResearchFolder", or "TrashFolder" for the top-level Draft/Manuscript, Research, and Trash nodes[\[21\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,21%2017%3A38%3A18%20%2B0000%22%20Type%3D%22Folder)[\[18\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%3CBinder%3E%20%3CBinderItem%20UUID%3D%2217807D28,Children). If the item is a media file (image, PDF, etc.), type might be "Image" or "Media" (Scrivener will treat content accordingly).

* **Title:** The visible Binder title of the document or folder, stored as a \<Title\> child element[\[22\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=00%3A27%3A34%20%2B0000,0%3C%2FTarget%3E%20%3C%2FTextSettings).

* **Timestamps:** Creation and last modified date/times are in attributes Created="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS \+0000" and Modified="YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS \+0000" (stored in UTC)[\[23\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,%3CTextSettings).

* **Metadata Flags:** Within each BinderItem, a \<MetaData\> sub-element holds metadata fields like label, status, compile flags, etc. For example, an item might have:

* \<MetaData\>  
      \<LabelID\>0\</LabelID\>  
      \<StatusID\>2\</StatusID\>  
      \<IncludeInCompile\>Yes\</IncludeInCompile\>  
  \</MetaData\>

* In this case, the document has Label ID 0, Status ID 2, and is marked to be included in compile[\[24\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,0%3C%2FTarget%3E%20%3C%2FTextSettings%3E%20%3C%2FBinderItem)[\[25\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=%3CStatus%20ID%3D%22,First%20Draft%3C%2FStatus).

  * **LabelID / StatusID:** Numerical identifiers linking to the project’s label and status definitions (described below). \-1 typically means “No Label/No Status” (the default)[\[26\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,Labels)[\[27\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=%3CDefaultStatusID%3E). If an item has no label or status assigned, these may be omitted or set to \-1.

  * **IncludeInCompile:** “Yes” or “No” flag indicating if this document should be included when compiling the manuscript output[\[28\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=hierarchy,print%20settings%2C%20search%20settings%20etc%E2%80%A6). (Scrivener defaults to including most items except perhaps notes or templates.)

  * **Section Type:** In Scrivener 3, each document can have a **Section Type** for compile formatting. This may appear as a \<SectionType\> element or attribute in the metadata (with the name or ID of the section type). The section type ties into compile settings but is stored in the project so each document knows its type.

  * **Custom Metadata:** Scrivener 3 allows user-defined custom metadata fields. These are stored per document as well. In the XML, each custom field might appear as a tag under \<MetaData\> (e.g. \<MyFieldName\>Value\</MyFieldName\> for a text field). The project file also defines these fields globally (see **Metadata Settings** below).

  * **Other Flags:** Additional compile flags (older versions had “Page Break Before”, “Compile As-Is”, etc.) could be present, though in v3 many of these are handled by Section Types. There may also be fields like \<AutoNumberID\> for numbering, etc., if used.

* **Text Content Placeholder:** The BinderItem entry itself does **not** contain the full text content of the document. Instead, Scrivener keeps the text in an external RTF file (in the Files folder). The binder entry may include a pointer or just rely on the ID/UUID for lookup. In older versions, the BinderItem sometimes had an \<Text\> element with a short excerpt or nothing at all – generally the content is not embedded (to keep the .scrivx file light). The presence of the ID/UUID is what maps it to a file on disk.

* **Children:** If a binder item contains subdocuments (e.g. a folder with children, or a document with text subdocuments), the XML will nest them. A BinderItem with children will have a \<Children\> element containing its child \<BinderItem\> entries recursively[\[29\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,%3CTextSettings%3E%20%3CTarget%20Type%3D%22Words%22%3E0%3C%2FTarget)[\[20\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,%3CTextSettings). This hierarchical nesting in XML mirrors the binder tree structure you see in Scrivener’s UI (indentation levels etc.).

* **Global Project Metadata Definitions:** After the Binder list, the .scrivx file defines global metadata lists used by the project. These include:

* **Label Settings:** The \<LabelSettings\> section defines the **Label** category. It has a \<Title\> (often default “Label” but user can rename it, e.g. to “POV” or “Theme”), a \<DefaultLabelID\> (usually \-1 meaning “No Label” by default), and a list of \<Labels\>[\[30\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,Labels). Each \<Label\> entry has an ID and a name, and often a color value. For example:

* \<LabelSettings\>  
      \<Title\>Label\</Title\>  
      \<DefaultLabelID\>-1\</DefaultLabelID\>  
      \<Labels\>  
          \<Label ID="-1"\>No Label\</Label\>  
          \<Label ID="0" Color="0.752941 0.752941 1.000000"\>Concept\</Label\>  
          \<Label ID="1" Color="1.000000 0.752941 0.752941"\>Chapter\</Label\>  
          \<\!-- etc... \--\>  
      \</Labels\>  
  \</LabelSettings\>

* This defines label “Concept” (ID 0, with an RGB color) and “Chapter” (ID 1, with a color), plus the special “No Label” (ID \-1)[\[31\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=%3CLabel%20ID%3D%22,Chapter%3C%2FLabel%3E%20%3C%2FLabels). Documents refer to these by the LabelID in their metadata.

* **Status Settings:** Similarly, \<StatusSettings\> defines the **Status** values. It includes a \<Title\> (default “Status”), a \<DefaultStatusID\> (usually \-1 for “No Status”), and a list \<StatusItems\> of \<Status\> entries. Example:

* \<StatusSettings\>  
      \<Title\>Status\</Title\>  
      \<DefaultStatusID\>-1\</DefaultStatusID\>  
      \<StatusItems\>  
          \<Status ID="-1"\>No Status\</Status\>  
          \<Status ID="0"\>N/A\</Status\>  
          \<Status ID="1"\>To Do\</Status\>  
          \<Status ID="2"\>First Draft\</Status\>  
          \<Status ID="3"\>Revised Draft\</Status\>  
          \<Status ID="4"\>Final Draft\</Status\>  
          \<Status ID="5"\>Done\</Status\>  
      \</StatusItems\>  
  \</StatusSettings\>

* This example (from the Scrivener tutorial) shows statuses like “To Do”, “First Draft”, etc. with their IDs[\[32\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=%3CStatus%20ID%3D%22,First%20Draft%3C%2FStatus). As with labels, binder items store a StatusID linking to one of these.

* **Keywords:** Scrivener projects maintain a global **Keywords list**. In the XML, a \<Keywords\> section contains all keywords defined in the project. Keywords can be hierarchical (you can group keywords under other keywords as categories). Each \<Keyword\> entry has an ID, a \<Title\> (the keyword text), a \<Color\> (optional color associated with the keyword), and optionally \<Children\> if a keyword has sub-keywords[\[33\]\[34\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,Keyword). For example:

* \<Keywords\>  
      \<Keyword ID="1"\>  
          \<Title\>Inspector\</Title\>  
          \<Color\>1.000000 1.000000 0.000000\</Color\>  
      \</Keyword\>  
      \<Keyword ID="3"\>  
          \<Title\>Characters\</Title\>  
          \<Color\>0.000000 0.000000 0.000000\</Color\>  
          \<Children\>  
              \<Keyword ID="5"\>  
                  \<Title\>Mary\</Title\>  
                  \<Color\>0.000000 0.470588 0.282353\</Color\>  
              \</Keyword\>  
              \<Keyword ID="4"\>  
                  \<Title\>Bill\</Title\>  
                  \<Color\>0.000000 0.239216 0.627451\</Color\>  
              \</Keyword\>  
          \</Children\>  
      \</Keyword\>  
      \<Keyword ID="2"\>  
          \<Title\>Assign this one\</Title\>  
          \<Color\>1.000000 0.000000 0.000000\</Color\>  
      \</Keyword\>  
  \</Keywords\>

* Here “Characters” (ID 3\) is a parent keyword with children “Mary” (ID 5\) and “Bill” (ID 4\) beneath it[\[35\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,%3CChildren)[\[36\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/uploads/short-url/ipKFkypltFGQa1BOTxfB0VF6BRR.PDF#:~:text=,Keyword). “Inspector” (ID 1\) and “Assign this one” (ID 2\) are other keywords. Documents can have any number of keywords; Scrivener likely stores the association in each BinderItem’s metadata (e.g. listing Keyword IDs assigned to that item). In the XML, a document might include its keywords via a list of \<Keywords\> or \<KeywordID\> entries under its metadata (the exact representation can vary by version).

* **Custom Meta-Data Settings:** If the project has **Custom Metadata fields** (user-defined fields for documents), the .scrivx will include a section that defines each field (name, type, etc.). For instance, a \<CustomMetaDataSettings\> section would list each field, possibly like:

* \<CustomMetaDataSettings\>  
     \<Field ID="0" Type="Text" Name="Point of View" /\>  
     \<Field ID="1" Type="Checkbox" Name="Needs Research" /\>  
  \</CustomMetaDataSettings\>

* And each BinderItem’s \<MetaData\> would have corresponding child elements for any of these fields with that item’s values (e.g. \<Point\_of\_View\>First Person\</Point\_of\_View\> or similar). This allows storing arbitrary metadata per document. *(The exact XML tags might differ; e.g. in Scrivener 3, custom meta might appear under \<MetaData\> or a separate section for each item.)*

* **Other Project Settings:** The .scrivx may also store other project-specific settings, such as *project notes* or *references*. In older versions, “Project Notes” (a scratchpad) and references (links to external or internal resources) were stored in the project file or associated plist. In Scrivener 3, “Project Bookmarks” (formerly references) might be stored either in the .scrivx or a separate file. There might be a \<ProjectNotes\> section or \<References\> section in the XML if those features are used.

* **User Interface State:** In modern Scrivener, most UI state has been moved out to the Settings files (described later). However, older .scrivx files (Scrivener 1.x/Windows) included some UI settings such as which binder items were expanded, current search selection, print settings, etc.[\[28\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=hierarchy,print%20settings%2C%20search%20settings%20etc%E2%80%A6). In current versions, the .scrivx is more focused on content structure and metadata, while UI/print/search settings are handled in separate files.

**Summary:** The .scrivx file is essentially a complete index of your project’s structure and metadata in XML form. It is what Scrivener loads first when opening a project. The presence of the \<BinderItem\> entries and their IDs/UUIDs tells Scrivener what content files to load on demand. Because .scrivx contains “every last bit of metadata” about the project (from binder hierarchy to labels, status, keywords, etc.), it is critical for reconstructing the project[\[5\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=4,filled%20glory). However, it does **not** contain the full text of your documents – those reside in the separate files described next.

## The Files Folder and Document Content Storage

All the actual document content you write or import (texts, images, PDFs, research materials) is stored in the Files subfolder of the project. This design (using an external folder for content) allows Scrivener to load documents on demand rather than holding everything in one huge file[\[37\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=I%20have%20recently%20been%20rewriting,movie%2C%20sound%2C%20PDF%20and%20image)[\[38\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=everything%20into%20memory%20right%20from,that%20aren%E2%80%99t%20currently%20being%20used). Within the Files directory, you’ll typically find:

* **Document Data Subfolder:** In newer Scrivener versions (Scrivener 3), there is a Files/Data folder, which contains one subfolder per document (using the document’s UUID as the folder name)[\[7\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=tree%20Scrivener3,indexes)[\[39\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=Within%20Data%2C%20there%20are%20about,size%20of%20any%20given%20binder). Each of these subfolders holds the content for that binder item. For example, a binder item with UUID 921B4A08-54C0-4B69-94FD-428F56FDAB89 would have a folder Files/Data/921B4A08-54C0-4B69-94FD-428F56FDAB89/ containing its content files[\[40\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Files%20%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Data,xml)[\[19\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%3CChildren%3E%20%3CBinderItem%20UUID%3D%22921B4A08,0600). Inside each such folder, the primary content is usually named content.rtf (for text documents)[\[40\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Files%20%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Data,xml)[\[41\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=In%20each%20hex%20folder%2C%20there,pdf). Scrivener stores textual content in Rich Text Format (RTF) files. This includes all formatting, annotations, and even embedded images in the text (images pasted into a text document are encoded in the RTF). RTF is a widely-supported format and Scrivener chose it for its compatibility and longevity[\[42\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=some%20work%20on%20the%20format,files%20and%20any%20other%20file)[\[43\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=2,be%20opened%20in%20a%20plain). (Older Mac Scrivener 1.x used RTFD packages for text, but this was changed to plain RTF for cross-platform compatibility[\[44\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=For%20Scrivener%202,rtf%20file)[\[43\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=2,be%20opened%20in%20a%20plain).)

If a binder item is not textual, its content file will have the appropriate format: e.g. for an imported PDF document, the folder might contain content.pdf instead of RTF[\[41\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=In%20each%20hex%20folder%2C%20there,pdf). Images might be stored as content.png or content.jpg (Scrivener keeps the original format of imported files). Essentially, each binder item’s folder will contain a single content.xxx file (RTF for text, or the original file for media). The Obsidian forum example noted that in one project all subfolders contained either a content.rtf or a content.pdf, and that the PDF ones corresponded to template/sample documents provided by Scrivener[\[41\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=In%20each%20hex%20folder%2C%20there,pdf)[\[45\]](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/potential-steps-to-import-a-scrivener-project-without-scrivener/102984#:~:text=The%20PDFs%20are%20the%20templatized,content%20contributed%20by%20the%20user). (These could be things like the title page template, etc., which Scrivener sometimes includes as PDF or static RTF in new projects.)

**Older Versions:** In Scrivener 1.x (Windows) and Scrivener 2.x (Mac), the content files were organized slightly differently. Instead of Files/Data/UUID/…, there was typically a **Files/Docs** folder containing RTF files named with numeric IDs (matching the BinderItem IDs in the XML). For example, a binder document with ID 8 would be stored as Files/Docs/8.rtf[\[46\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=Apologies%20for%20the%20delay%20in,you%20didn%E2%80%99t%20realize%20you%20had). Folders or documents with no text may have had no corresponding file or a zero-length file. (In those versions, all documents were in one flat Docs folder; Scrivener 3 moved to nested folders named by UUID to avoid name collisions and support the new persistent identifiers.)

Regardless of version, the content files can be opened outside Scrivener (e.g. you can open the RTF in Word or WordPad to see your text), but it’s not recommended to edit them outside Scrivener, as the .scrivx metadata and indexes might get out of sync.

* **Auxiliary Files in Files:** The Files folder also contains various support files that Scrivener uses for performance and data integrity:

* **docs.checksum:** Located in Files/Data (for Scrivener 3 projects)[\[40\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Files%20%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Data,xml), this file stores checksums of each document’s last saved state. It helps Scrivener detect which documents have changed between sessions. On project load, Scrivener can compare checksums to know which files need re-indexing or syncing[\[47\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=applicable). This avoids expensive re-indexing of all files every time – only changed files are processed (the feature that eliminated the old “Synchronising…” progress bar on open)[\[48\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=,single%20file%20in%20the%20project).

* **Search Indexes:** A file (or folder) named search.indexes stores a full-text index of the project for fast search results[\[49\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20docs,s01.scrivx%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Settings). This is likely a binary or compressed index of all words in your documents. If it’s a file, Scrivener updates it when documents change (guided by the checksum file). The presence of a valid index allows instant binder searches. If missing or outdated, Scrivener will regenerate it (you might see a “rebuilding search indexes” message, as noted when the Mobile folder merges[\[50\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/mobile-folder-in-project-folder/121177#:~:text=EDIT%3A%20It%E2%80%99s%20seems%20to%20have,and%20the%20Mobile%20folder%20disappears)[\[13\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/mobile-folder-in-project-folder/121177#:~:text=,and%20the%20Mobile%20folder%20disappears)).

* **Binder Auto-Backup Files:** In Scrivener 3, you’ll often see binder.autosave and binder.backup in the Files folder[\[49\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20docs,s01.scrivx%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Settings)[\[51\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/cannot-access-scrivx-file/138817#:~:text=Just%20found%20another%20project%20that,you%20listed%20but%20no%20Template). These are backups of the binder structure (project XML) used for recovery. binder.autosave is typically an automatically saved copy of the .scrivx at the last save point (in case the main scrivx gets corrupted mid-session). binder.backup may be a previous session’s binder or a rolling backup. Essentially, Scrivener can fall back to these if the main .scrivx is unreadable. They are XML files (same format as scrivx) but given different extensions to distinguish them. Normally, these files are small (just text metadata) and you won’t interact with them directly – Scrivener manages them.

* **version.txt:** This file notes the project format version. For example, it might contain something like “Scrivener 3.0” or an internal version code. Its presence helps the software determine if it needs to run a format upgrade. (For instance, opening a Scrivener 1 project in Scrivener 3 triggers a format conversion – the version.txt likely changes from 1 to 2, etc.)[\[49\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20docs,s01.scrivx%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Settings).

* **styles.xml:** Scrivener 3 introduced a styles system (named text styles like “Heading” or “Block Quote”). The file styles.xml in the Files folder contains the definitions of any custom styles used in the project[\[49\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20docs,s01.scrivx%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Settings). This includes style names and the RTF formatting associated with each style. Scrivener uses this to apply consistent formatting to text marked with those styles.

* **writing.history:** A log of writing session statistics[\[49\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20docs,s01.scrivx%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Settings). Scrivener 3 tracks your daily writing progress (how many words added per day, etc.) in the **Project Writing History**. The writing.history file stores this data, likely in plain text or XML form (e.g. date entries and word counts). This allows the **Writing History** feature to show your past activity.

* **Other files:** There might be additional files for specific features. For example, if the project used **“External Folder Sync”**, there could be a file or folder tracking the sync settings. If the project has **scriptwriting** elements, there might be a characters.xml or similar for character name autocompletions (just hypothetical examples). Generally, any feature that needs to store data (beyond the binder XML) will either store it in the .scrivx or as a file in Files/ or Settings/.

**Research and Media Files:** Aside from text documents, Scrivener allows you to import research materials (images, PDFs, web pages, videos, etc.) into the binder (usually under the Research folder). These are stored in the same Files/Data structure. If you import, say, a PDF named Article.pdf into Research, Scrivener will assign it a UUID and create a folder in Files/Data/\<UUID\>/content.pdf containing the PDF data. The binder entry for it (Type="Image" or "PDF") points to that file. Similarly, an imported webpage might be stored as content.html or as an archived webarchive inside a folder. **Important:** Scrivener copies these files into the project, which is why the project folder can grow large if you have many research files. They are *not* stored as links (unless you explicitly use “References/Bookmarks” to link externally).

## Snapshots Storage

Scrivener’s **Snapshots** feature allows you to save prior versions of a document’s text. All snapshots are stored within the project’s Snapshots folder. This folder resides at the top level of the project ( alongside Files, Settings, etc.)[\[11\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-to-see-overall-size-of-snapshots-and-delete-old-ones/132297#:~:text=Navigate%20into%20your%20,seconds%20for%20that%20to%20happen)[\[52\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-to-see-overall-size-of-snapshots-and-delete-old-ones/132297#:~:text=Snapshots%20folder%20is%20one%20level,scriv%20folder%2C%20%40GoalieDad). The internal structure of the Snapshots folder is organized by document. For each binder document that has snapshots, there will be a subfolder (often named by the document’s ID or UUID). Inside that, each snapshot is stored as an RTF file (just like a regular content file) containing the text of that document at the time of the snapshot. The filenames often include the date or the snapshot title. For example, you might see Snapshots/8/2018-07-01-1030.rtf for a snapshot taken on July 1, 2018 of document ID 8 (in older projects). In Scrivener 3, with UUIDs, they may use the UUID as the folder name. The exact naming conventions can vary, but essentially the Snapshots directory tree parallels the Docs/Data structure: it keeps old copies of content that are not active but for user reference.

When you view snapshots in Scrivener’s interface, it is reading these RTF files. Snapshots are not listed in the binder XML; they live separately. This means if you delete something in the binder, its snapshots might still reside until the project is cleaned up. Conversely, copying a document between projects does not carry its snapshots by default (unless done via special methods) because they’re not part of the main binder structure.

**Managing Snapshots:** Snapshots can take up space. To gauge snapshot storage, one can inspect the Snapshots folder on disk (e.g. on Windows, right-click \> Properties to see size)[\[11\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-to-see-overall-size-of-snapshots-and-delete-old-ones/132297#:~:text=Navigate%20into%20your%20,seconds%20for%20that%20to%20happen). Scrivener also provides a **Snapshots Manager** within the app to review and delete older snapshots without manually digging in the folder[\[53\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-to-see-overall-size-of-snapshots-and-delete-old-ones/132297#:~:text=if%20it%20has%20no%20way,content%20is%20in%20a%20folder). The Snapshots folder is safe from regular Scrivener updates – e.g. updating Scrivener or minor version changes will not remove snapshots[\[54\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/does-updating-scrivener-remove-snapshots/135671#:~:text=Vincent_Vincent%20%20August%205%2C%202023%2C,1%3A27am%20%202). However, when **upgrading** a project from Scrivener 1 to 3 format, snapshots were initially not converted, but this was later fixed in the official release so that snapshots are upgraded as well (migrated into the new structure)[\[55\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/does-updating-scrivener-remove-snapshots/135671#:~:text=Does%20anyone%20know%20if%20updating,Scrivener%20remove%20snapshots)[\[56\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/does-updating-scrivener-remove-snapshots/135671#:~:text=The%20only%20safe%20way%20to,created%20in%20the%20same%20folder). Essentially, the converter renames and moves old snapshots into the new Snapshots folder format. It is *not* recommended to manually copy snapshot files between projects; use the upgrade or export functions to handle them[\[57\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/does-updating-scrivener-remove-snapshots/135671#:~:text=state%20will%20be%20created%20in,the%20same%20folder)[\[58\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/does-updating-scrivener-remove-snapshots/135671#:~:text=Hmm%2C%20strange%2C%20was%20that%20back,now%20properly%20upgrade%20to%20Bookmarks).

In summary, the Snapshots folder contains RTF files of prior document versions, organized by doc ID/UUID. They are separate from the main content files, ensuring that they don’t clutter the current working version but are accessible when needed. Always include the Snapshots folder in backups if you want those historical versions preserved.

## Settings and UI Files (Settings Folder)

Scrivener projects also carry a Settings directory which holds miscellaneous project settings and UI state that are not part of the core manuscript data. These files are mostly for Scrivener’s own use, and they ensure that when you reopen a project, it looks and behaves as you left it. Common files in Settings include:

* **ui.ini and ui-common.xml:** These store the user interface layout and state for the project. For example, the UI files can record which pane you last had open, the width of the binder sidebar, whether the inspector was visible, etc. They may also store which document was last viewed or selected. On Windows, ui.ini (an INI-format file) is used for some UI settings, whereas ui-common.xml (an XML file) contains platform-independent UI settings[\[9\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20writing.history%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Scrivener3,common.xml%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20ui.ini). On Mac, an equivalent might be a plist or also an XML. Essentially, these files keep track of the **“state”** of the project’s interface (but not the content). If you delete them, Scrivener will revert to defaults for window layout next time.

* **recents.txt:** This is a simple text file that lists recently opened documents within the project[\[9\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=%E2%94%82%C2%A0%C2%A0%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20writing.history%20%E2%94%9C%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20Scrivener3,common.xml%20%E2%94%94%E2%94%80%E2%94%80%20ui.ini). Scrivener’s **Go To \> Recent Documents** menu for the project is populated from here. It might list document IDs/UUIDs or names that were recently edited, so you can quickly jump back to them. Clearing this file would reset that history.

* **project.scrpref (Scrivener 2\) or Compile settings:** In older versions, compile settings and print settings might have been stored in the project file. In Scrivener 3, if you save custom compile settings to the project, those might be saved in Settings (for example, as a file named after the compile format or a .plist). The existence of files like compile.xml or similar is possible if compile settings are stored. If the user created any **project-specific settings** (like custom substitutions, per-project formatting preferences), those could also reside here.

* **translations.ini (Windows only):** Some older Windows projects had an INI for interface language or encoding, if needed. Probably not common in v3.

* **Miscellaneous:** There may be files for specific features. For instance, if you used **scriptwriting mode**, settings for script format might be saved (though those are often global, not per-project). If the project had **metadata display settings** (which columns to show in outliner, etc.), those might be stored here too.

One notable thing in Scrivener 3 is the separation of concerns: The project’s content and outline are in the .scrivx, while purely UI stuff (which doesn’t affect the meaning of the project) is in these auxiliary files. This way, two users can work on the same project and have different UI preferences without altering the core project file. It also means if a UI file gets corrupted or deleted, you haven’t lost creative data – just the settings which can be reset.

## Mac vs Windows Differences and Historical Formats

Originally, Scrivener was Mac-only, and the project format evolved over time. By Scrivener 2.0 (Mac) and Scrivener 1 (Windows), the format had converged to an XML-based package with similar structure on both platforms[\[6\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=The%20XML%20has%20enough%20to,3%20uses%20project%20version%202). Key points:

* **Package vs Folder:** On macOS, a .scriv is a “document package” – the Finder shows it as a file, but under the hood it’s a folder[\[59\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=Since%20the%20developers%20of%20Scrivener,called%20a%20Document%20Package%20format)[\[60\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=Image). This is achieved by macOS Launch Services recognizing the .scriv extension and treating it as a package type[\[59\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=Since%20the%20developers%20of%20Scrivener,called%20a%20Document%20Package%20format)[\[61\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=kMDItemContentModificationDate_Ranking%20%3D%202025,public.content). Users can **Right-click \> Show Package Contents** to inspect it. On Windows, no such packaging exists, so you see a normal folder. Functionally the contents are the same.

* **Scrivener 1 (Mac) vs Scrivener 2/3:** Mac Scrivener 1.x used Apple’s binary property list for the binder (binder.scrivproj). It also used RTFD for texts and .plist files for settings[\[44\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=For%20Scrivener%202,rtf%20file)[\[62\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=type%3B%20but%20the%20trouble%20is,plist%20stands%20for%20%E2%80%9Cproperty%20list%E2%80%9D). This made the format essentially Mac-only. With Scrivener 2 (2010), the format changed: all text content became .RTF files, and XML files (.scrivx on Windows, .scrivproj XML on Mac) were introduced for binder and metadata[\[43\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=2,be%20opened%20in%20a%20plain)[\[63\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=3%29%20Instead%20of%20using%20,XML%20file%20formats%20where%20applicable). This made projects largely cross-platform. Scrivener 3 further unified the format (both Mac and Windows Scrivener 3 use the same “version 2.0” project structure as indicated in the .scrivx)[\[6\]](https://preservation.tylerthorsted.com/tag/proprietary/#:~:text=The%20XML%20has%20enough%20to,3%20uses%20project%20version%202). Mac Scrivener 3 can open Windows Scrivener 3 projects and vice versa without conversion.

* **Version Compatibility:** A Scrivener 3 project cannot be opened directly in Scrivener 1 or 2 – it must be downgraded. Conversely, opening an old project in Scrivener 3 will prompt to upgrade the project (the software will convert the files and update folder structure automatically)[\[56\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/does-updating-scrivener-remove-snapshots/135671#:~:text=The%20only%20safe%20way%20to,created%20in%20the%20same%20folder). It creates a backup of the old project in the process. After upgrade, you’ll see the new structure (e.g. Files/Data instead of Files/Docs, project.scrivx instead of binder.scrivproj, etc.). All metadata (labels, status, keywords, notes) should carry over, and snapshots should carry over as of the final release (earlier betas lost them)[\[64\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/does-updating-scrivener-remove-snapshots/135671#:~:text=AmberV%20%20August%206%2C%202023%2C,11%3A55pm%20%206)[\[58\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/does-updating-scrivener-remove-snapshots/135671#:~:text=Hmm%2C%20strange%2C%20was%20that%20back,now%20properly%20upgrade%20to%20Bookmarks).

Aside from these, Mac and Windows handle file paths and OS integrations differently (e.g. macOS uses QuickLook previews as mentioned, whereas Windows doesn’t). But the core content is the same in the project.

## Example Project Structure

To tie everything together, here is an example layout of a Scrivener 3 project’s files (from a sample project):

MyProject.scriv  
├── MyProject.scrivx    (the main project XML index)  
├── Files  
│   ├── Data  
│   │   ├── 921B4A08-54C0-4B69-94FD-428F56FDAB89  
│   │   │   └── content.rtf    (text of a document with that UUID)  
│   │   ├──  ... (other UUID-named folders for each document)  
│   │   └── docs.checksum      (checksums for document files)  
│   ├── binder.autosave        (auto-saved copy of project XML)   
│   ├── binder.backup          (backup copy of project XML)  
│   ├── search.indexes         (search index data)  
│   ├── styles.xml             (text style definitions for this project)  
│   ├── version.txt            (project format/version info)  
│   └── writing.history        (daily writing statistics log)  
├── Snapshots  
│   ├── 921B4A08-54C0-4B69-94FD-428F56FDAB89  
│   │   ├── Snapshot-2023-01-15.rtf   (snapshot of that doc on Jan 15 2023\)  
│   │   └── ... (other snapshots for that document)  
│   └── ... (folders for other documents with snapshots)  
├── QuickLook  
│   ├── Preview.html           (Quick Look preview data for Finder)  
│   └── Thumbnail.png          (an icon or thumbnail image)  
└── Settings  
    ├── recents.txt            (recent documents history)  
    ├── ui-common.xml          (common UI layout settings)  
    └── ui.ini                 (Windows-specific UI settings)

*The above is representative; exact file names can vary.* For instance, on macOS the QuickLook folder typically contains a generated PDF or HTML for preview. If no QuickLook data exists, that folder may not be present. Similarly, if no snapshots have been taken, the Snapshots folder may not exist until needed[\[65\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-to-see-overall-size-of-snapshots-and-delete-old-ones/132297#:~:text=GoalieDad%20%20January%2027%2C%202023%2C,5%3A33pm%20%204)[\[52\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-to-see-overall-size-of-snapshots-and-delete-old-ones/132297#:~:text=Snapshots%20folder%20is%20one%20level,scriv%20folder%2C%20%40GoalieDad). The presence of binder.autosave or binder.backup might vary (Scrivener might create them during editing sessions and remove or update them on close).

This structure highlights why backing up the whole folder is critical: your writing is in the RTF files, but without the .scrivx index and the metadata files, it would be very cumbersome to piece everything together. Conversely, the .scrivx alone is not useful without the Files/Data content files – it’s like an index without the book. Scrivener’s design trades one monolithic file for a folder of many files; this improves performance (only load what’s needed) and reduces risk (if one file corrupts, others might still be okay)[\[37\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=I%20have%20recently%20been%20rewriting,movie%2C%20sound%2C%20PDF%20and%20image)[\[38\]](https://lit-n-lat.blogspot.com/2010/02/coding-xml-formats-in-cocoa_05.html#links#:~:text=everything%20into%20memory%20right%20from,that%20aren%E2%80%99t%20currently%20being%20used). The downside is the complexity of many parts – which we’ve broken down above.

## Conclusion

Every element in Scrivener’s file format serves a purpose: the .scrivx XML defines the structure and metadata (binder order, labels, statuses, etc.[\[66\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=an%20XML%20text%20file%20that,print%20settings%2C%20search%20settings%20etc%E2%80%A6)), while the Files directory stores the actual content (rich-text files, media) and supporting data like search indices and backups. Metadata such as labels, status, keywords, and custom fields are both globally defined in the project file and referenced per document so that Scrivener can provide powerful organizational features (color-coded index cards, status stamps, keyword searches, etc.).

By understanding this format, advanced users can, for example, recover text from an RTF if needed, or identify a project’s components in cloud backups. It also illustrates how Scrivener keeps your work safe: even if the program crashes, the existence of autosave files, backups, and separate resource files helps prevent data loss[\[67\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/how-a-scrivener-project-is-structured/9717#:~:text=an%20XML%20text%20file%20that,print%20settings%2C%20search%20settings%20etc%E2%80%A6)[\[68\]](https://forum.literatureandlatte.com/t/cannot-access-scrivx-file/138817#:~:text=I%20only%20have%20Files%20and,my%20firewall%20but%20no%20difference). However, editing or moving things by hand is not recommended unless you have a very clear picture of these relationships.

In summary, a Scrivener project is essentially a **self-contained database in folder form** – a digital binder where each section is an RTF file and the .scrivx is the table of contents (plus card catalog of metadata) that ties it all together[\[69\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/scrivener/comments/1etxdjw/scrivx_format_and_updating_behind_the_apps_back/#:~:text=Scrivener%20projects%20are%20nested%20folders,and%20the%20metadata%20being%20XML). Both the Mac and Windows versions adhere to this format (with minor differences largely resolved by Scrivener 3), making it possible to collaborate or switch platforms smoothly. All of the metadata – from synopsis, labels, and status to compile settings and snapshots – are stored within this structure, enabling the rich feature set that writers rely on. With this detailed breakdown, one can appreciate how **everything** in a Scrivener project is structured and where “every field” lives within the project’s files.
